# Steam Duck - PAWO (Personal Autonomous Walking Optimizer)

![PAWO Image](assets/images/robot.png)

I started the project at the end of November 2023 as my own version of the BDX Droid from Disney Imagineering. The original code name was **Steam Duck**, but for stylistic reasons I later renamed it after the mythical peacock (the star constellation *Pavo*). After that, I came up with an acronym, so the name became **P.A.W.O. (Personal Autonomous Walking Optimizer)**.

Finally, during an exhibition in Brno in October 2025, some students jokingly called the robot a **“futuristic chicken.”**

So yes — this project has had many names and versions. But no matter what the name is, it remains a very cool experiment in figuring out how to build a beautiful machine like the BDX Droid using only off-the-shelf components. The idea is to make it possible for anyone to build it with just 3D-printed parts, a screwdriver, and standard hobby-shop materials.

# Steam Duck v1

First version of the droid with simple likages, simple joints with hope everything will magicaly work...which wasn't.
